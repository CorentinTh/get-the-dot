# Get-the-dot

Test it [here](http://divers.corentin-thomasset.fr/get-the-dot).

A small tiny game created for the course **API for the WEB** at the university of Metropolia.

In this collaborative game, the goal is to move your  player in order to eat a red dot before the other players.

### Functioning

This game is a *serverless* application, I mean that I did not build any server to make it works.

It uses a ready made [PB2](https://github.com/OAlm/pb2) websocket server.

### Disclaimer

I am aware that this tiny game has a lot of security issues and that it's easy to cheat. But I repeat that the main goal of this application was to practice web sockets. And in the other hand it's nearly impossible to build such kind of *serverless* application in a secure way.
